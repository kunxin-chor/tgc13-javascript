// declare a variable. i.e to create a new variable
let x = 42;  // assign 42 to the variable x. 
x = 57;  // to reassign, simply refer to the variable by its name

var b = 33; // var is outdated. We don't use it anymore

// constant variable
const pi = 3.14; // we cannot reassign back to it.

// console.log is Javascript's eqv of print
console.log("Area of cirlce:", x**2 * 3.14);
